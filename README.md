# Hospital Patient Process Analysis (Celonis)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **Celonis** to perform process mining on a hospital event log. The goal was to visualize patient pathways, identify bottlenecks in the admission-to-discharge process, and analyze deviations from the ideal process flow.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Process Mining:** Celonis (Academic Cloud)
* **Data Source:** Hospital Mini Dataset 2024 (CSV log file)
* **Concepts:** Process Discovery, Variant Analysis, Throughput Time Calculation

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **Happy Path:** The most common patient journey is [Enter Emergency -> Internal Medicine -> Discharge].
* **Bottlenecks:** Identified that patients transferring between [Department A] and [Department B] experience the longest wait times.
* *(Replace the above with your actual findings from the assignment)*

## 📸 Process Visualizations

*Analysis of outliers and non-standard patient loops.*

This analysis was conducted as an Academic Case Study to demonstrate proficiency in Process Mining and Data Discovery using Celonis.
